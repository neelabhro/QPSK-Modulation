% Determines when to sample the matched filter outputs. The synchronization
% algorithm is based on cross-correlating a replica of the (known)
% transmitted training sequence with the output from the matched filter
% (before sampling). Different starting points in the matched filter output
% are tried and the shift yielding the largest value of the absolute value
% of the cross-correlation is chosen as the sampling instant for the first
% symbol.
%
% Input:
%   mf            = matched filter output, complex baseband, I+jQ
%   b_train       = the training sequence bits
%   Q             = number of samples per symbol
%   t_start       = start of search window
%   t_end         = end of search window
%
% Output:
%   t_samp = sampling instant for first symbol
